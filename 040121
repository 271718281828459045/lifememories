"Homework is as important as studying" (040121)

Today, I got the adverage score back from the teacher. It was 88%. However, it is still low concidering to my expatations. 
When looking at the distrubution of grades, it was mostly homework that was the main contrubuter. It taught me that putting more effort into my homework 
could be as benifical as studying.
